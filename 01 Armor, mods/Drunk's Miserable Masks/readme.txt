-Module:
Drunk's Miserable Masks [Drunk_Headcrab]

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
NOTE: You still need the original mod. Disable the o_helmets.ltx file.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
DLTX conversion, with minor fixes.

I don't carry over the Nosorog/Spartan nerf and Apocalypse buff. While I understand Drunk's rationale, it seems appropiate for Gamma or Separated Helmets games but unneeded in vanilla games, nerfing nosorogs from what advantage they have over normal exos. Of course, that means Gamma and Separated Helmet players may want to opt out of using this.

Also reworked text file to not overwrite others, and icon file for DX8-9 compliance.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Patches:

DICK patch - DLTXd
The DICK patch is a DLTXd repatch of the original included by Drunk. It added the heavy Clear Sky helmet to the looting pool of different DICK NPC spawns using Clear Sky models, but it didn't do so for vanilla NPCs. Now it also does so.

CS Helmet for vanilla spawns addon
This does the same for those who play vanilla without DICK or GAMMA. It's not needed if you use the new DICK patch.
