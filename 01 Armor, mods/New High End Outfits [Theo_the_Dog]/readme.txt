-Module:
New High End Outfits [Theo_the_Dog] 

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
Original mod not required.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:

Consolidated outfit sheets by having them inherit from the outfits they based on (I had to guess a bit, but I'm pretty sure I got them) and use vanilla data sections instead of unnecessary new ones.

In addition, added NPC spawns that can wear and drop the outfits (two NPCs per outfit, one NPC in ranks 3 and 4 of the respective faction), and made them sellable.

Includes integration to 1st Person View and Grok's Stash Overhaul.
