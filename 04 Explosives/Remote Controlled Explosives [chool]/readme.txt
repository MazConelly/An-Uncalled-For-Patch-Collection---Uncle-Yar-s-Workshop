-Module:
Remote Controlled Explosives and Pocket Bombs [chool]

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
NOTE: You must disable the configs folder in the original mod.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
DLTX conversion.

The audio file was also lacking a comment, and the English text has been given a small touch.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Patches:
Anomalous Mines: Avoids crashes to desktop and allows you to plant anomalous IEDs as per Remote Controlled Explosives's features. Yes, even in someone's pockets. Must load after the original Remote Controlled Explosives, whether you use my DLTXd files or not.
