-Module:
Sturmgewehr 57 [popattara]

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
NOTE: Make sure to disable the original gamedata/scripts/weapon_cover_tilt_gun_trigger_radii.script file, or that WCT loads after it.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
A few things done here. First, the gun itself is now categorized as an assault rifle, has its muzzle velocity nerfed to the realitic 750 m/s, and its range to 800 meters (from 2500!!). Power and push are also nerfed to that of a G3.

Second, the standard icon file is also fixed to work in DX8-9, and the text is also corrected for omissions, including the (vanilla) attachments that can be applied for it.

Its support for Weapon Cover Tilt it's fixed. It monkey patches things properly instead of inefectually replacing the original script with a DLTX method, or worse, breaking WCT itself depending of the load rder. Thanks to MRdemonized and Vodoxleb for the tips.

As an aside, technically the real SG 510 is chambered in 7.5Ã—55mm GP 11 rounds which I'm not making for this, so this is actually a SG 510-4 variant with the 510's face. We could make it actually be the 510-4, but that would need messing with textures first and I ain't getting into that now.

Integration into Grok's Stash Overhaul, GBOOBS, and PDA Interactive.

-Patches:

Vanilla silencer. The SR25 silencer will be used instead of a BaS one, for those who play without BaS.
