-Module:
Mateba Unica 6 [ATHIS]

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
NOTE: You need the original mod. Disable the configs folders.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
ATHIS' edit is a proper rework of the TAZ Mateba that I already patched for Diphenhydramine-HCl's version, with a Custom version that supports BaS scopes. I recommend ATHIS' over Diphenhydramine-HCl's if you can find it; he also has a 3DSS version that should be compatible with these patches. I think. Do tell otherwise.

The main file -requires- Speedloaders and ammo for revolvers. It adds duplicates of each version chambered in .44, though do note I nerf the range and weight of all (four in total) revolvers.

Integration into Grok's Stash Overhaul and PDA Interactive.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Patches:

Revolver Parts. Grants each gun the appropiate parts, as available.

Armor Modkits addon. The specialized mod kit turns the base Mateba of either caliber into their Custom version.
