DOWNLOAD FROM THE GITHUB REPO: https://github.com/MazConelly/An-Uncalled-for-Patch-Collection/blob/main/05%20Textures/_DX8-9%20textures/Blades%20of%20the%20Zone.7z

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
Let this overwrite the original mod.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
The texture compression for this mod only works for DX11. That means the textures wouldn't show up in DX8-9. Now they do. A tad darker than they should be, though. They're also resized to 1k instead of 2k for potatoes.

The icon file has also been optimized.

-Patches:

----------------------------------------------------------
-Known issues:
Probably they won't look good in DX10-11 but that's not what you'd be downloading this, wouldn't it?
