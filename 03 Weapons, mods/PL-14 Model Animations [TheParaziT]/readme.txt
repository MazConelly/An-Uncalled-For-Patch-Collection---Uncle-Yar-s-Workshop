-Module:
PL-14 Model Animations [TheParaziT]

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
I *think* you only need LarryLangosta's fix, at the bottom of the comments for TheParaziT's original mod, but get both versions just in case. Overwrite it with LarryLangosta's.

NOTE: You need to disable the gamedata\configs\loadouts folder in both of them.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
This mod and LarryLangosta's fix use a non conventional method of adding the gun to NPC loadouts. I made a simple DLTX file for it, plus added the gun to traders. Given the PL-14 was a demonstrative design of the later-adopted PL-15, only Army will carry and sell it, with the exception of Nimble and expert loners.
