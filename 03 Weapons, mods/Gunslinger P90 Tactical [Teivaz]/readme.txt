-Module:
Gunslinger P90 Tactical [Teivaz]

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
NOTE: You still need the original mod (if you can find it). Disable the folders items and loadouts in gamedata/configs, and the gamedata\meshes\anomaly_weapons\wpn_p90 folder.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
This abomina-ahem, mod has been removed from Moddb, but in case you still have it or find it, you can use this.

This weapon inherited the data of the base P90. To ensure compatibility with other mods, the P90 Tactical has been independized away.

It also didn't work NPC loadouts like every other kid. This is now fixed. It also adds it to traders. To accommodate it in the higher supply tier, the normal P90 is moved down one supply lower.

Integration into Grok's Stash Overhaul and PDA Interactive.

-Patches:

Boomsticks and Sharpsticks. To use the BaS scopes.
