-Module:
.50 Beowulf Weapon Pack [PurpleSkyGuy, GhostArmory, JMERC] 

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
NOTE: You still need the original mod. Disable the the mod_system files in the configs folder, and the folders textures/ui, configs/text.

Do not install the original mod's Ammo Bullet Icons.

You can disable the original Mags Redux patch as well.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
Configs and icon files are now consolidated into a single file each. This way there's fewer itty bitty loose files to load. The Mags Redux patch is also given this treatment, and integrated into the main files.

Technically they say there will be more guns. So if the mod ever updates, this patch may probably cease to be useful.

Integration into Grok's Stash Overhaul and PDA Interactive.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Patches:
Revolver Parts. Grants the gun the appropiate parts, as available.

Vanilla silencers. Weapons will use vanilla silencers instead of BaS ones.
