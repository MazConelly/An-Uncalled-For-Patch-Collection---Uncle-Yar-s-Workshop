-Module:
RPG26 [AnthonyIrwin]

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
For AnthonyIrwin's 2.2 version, not any of the older ones.

NOTE: You still need the original mod. Disable folders textures/ui and configs/items/weapons.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
Added it to the looting and treasure pool, and to the army and Monolith traders; the 2.2 distributes it to several traders but not the most obvious one. :P

The icon file has also been resized.
