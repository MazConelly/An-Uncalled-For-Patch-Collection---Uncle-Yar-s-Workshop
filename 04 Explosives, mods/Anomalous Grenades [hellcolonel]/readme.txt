-Module:
Anomalous Grenades [hellcolonel]

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
NOTE: You still need the original non-config assets.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
DLTX conversion.

Also deleted the Misery base.ltx, isolated the text file to avoid overwrites, deleted the modded exes text file (Â¿?), size of the icon texture reduced, and added crafting recipes: you need 1 grenade and one artifact.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Patches:
My BCSI Patch Collection includes patches for the new recipes.

-Known issues:
