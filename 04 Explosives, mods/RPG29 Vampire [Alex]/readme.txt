-Module:
RPG29 Vampire [Alex]

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
NOTE: You still need the original mod. Disable Disable the configs and the textures/ui folders.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
The mod was so incomplete, it wasn't actually implemented in the game world.

DLTX'd item files, merged and fixed text files (also trimmed excessive data from the English text), fixed icon file (ANOTHER UI_ICON_EQUIPMENT!? AND MODDED!?), and added trade and stash files.
