-Module:
Military SEVA armor for the player [cyborgcore]

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
NOTE: You need the model meshes and textures from the original mod; disable its configs and ui textures.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
Streamlined and fixes trader and text files. DLTX'd the items_actor_legs.ltx files to not be overwritten by other mods, and remade icons taking the 3D model as basis (the upgrade icon was too tiny).

Includes integration for Grok's Stash Overhaul.
