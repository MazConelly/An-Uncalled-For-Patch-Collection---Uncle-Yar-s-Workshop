-Module:
Built Different [volnerowich]

-Compatibility:
Original mod not required.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
DLTX conversion. Kept only the weight/inventory weight changes, as seemingly intended. Includes the belt slots changes, but disabled due to uncertainty of intention (plus, an outfit with more than 5 slots, without something like Adjustable Equipment Weight, may cause issues).

NOTE: the Ghillie stats were changed to pair with Crea's Ghillie tweak Stealth addon at the Anomaly Discord.
