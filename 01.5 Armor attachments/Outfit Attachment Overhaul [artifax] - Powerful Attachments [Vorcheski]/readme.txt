-Module:
Outfit Attachment Overhaul [artifax] - Powerful Attachments [Vorcheski] patch

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
Make sure you use the last Github version of OAO.
https://github.com/ahuyn/anomaly-armor-attachments

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
PA says it works better with OAO, but some of its values overwrite the higher ones from OAO with lower ones (independently from load order as its a DLTX mod).

Values affected are additional_inventory_weight and additional_inventory_weight2 for frames and grids (base and improved) and improved camelback. I deleted those values to let OAO's prevail.
