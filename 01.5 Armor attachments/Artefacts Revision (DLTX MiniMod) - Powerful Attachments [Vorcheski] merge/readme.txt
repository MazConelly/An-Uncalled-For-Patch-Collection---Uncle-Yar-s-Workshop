-Module:
Artefacts Revision (DLTX MiniMod) [Demonized] - POWERFUL ATTACHMENTS [vorcheski] merge

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
NOTE: You must also disable pr hide PA's mod_system_better_mutant_parts.ltx, or let this patch overwrite it.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
MMR has bigger buffs, but lacks some that PA does. This file merges them so no value is left behind. Might need some further work to standardize values between the two, though.

Also removed artefact bleeding buffs in favor of PA's, retains only the Oasis Heart healing.
