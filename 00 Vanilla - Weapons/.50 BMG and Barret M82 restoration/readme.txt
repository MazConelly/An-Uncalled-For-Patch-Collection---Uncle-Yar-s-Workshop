-Module:
.50 BMG ammo and Barret M82 restoration

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
Incompatible with similar mods.

Must load after Mags Redux.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
This allows the Barret M82 to use .50 BMG ammo as normal, and restores the .50 BMG ammo. Other mods tried to do so but I remember them being clunky and/or merged with 4.6 ammo restorations. Not quite a fix patch, but not quite big enough to justify its own mod page. Also not a "for fun" mod; the Anomaly devs presumably made the M82 chambered in 12.7x55 because otherwise it'd be the only gun using the .50 BGM, and it makes it harder to restock. You're warned.

The M82 should now hit harder, faster and farther than the rest of snipers and calibers, but not as the Gauss. You may see NPCs being pushed a few meters (in lieu of just becoming a big crater). The standard .50 BGM is craftable and distributed to some traders in very limited quantities (CS, Freedom, ISG, mercs, and Monolith, so you can restock at any longitude of the Zone).

Do note that the standard .50 BMG remains highly scarce and it's not added to stashes or rewards. All this makes using the M82 a more difficult and focused task. It's overkill for the Zone after all.

It is patched for Mags Redux, to make the magazine loads .50 instead of 12.7x55. Make sure it loads after Mags Redux itself.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Patches:
Anomaly Ballistics: the AP ammo is also craftable and added to traders at very high goodwill, with AB's new descriptions applied properly.
I left AB to set the stats, as I assume there's a game plan there. I may be wrong and the work it's simply incomplete; I'm not a ballistics guy, so feel free to mention anything that should be changed.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Known issues:
For some reason the M82 tooltip only shows the standard .50 ammo, but that's not a big issue.
