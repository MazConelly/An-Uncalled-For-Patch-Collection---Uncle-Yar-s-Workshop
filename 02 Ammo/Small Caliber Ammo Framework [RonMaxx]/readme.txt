-Module:
Small Caliber Ammo Framework [RonMaxx]

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
Use of Arti's Ballistics is recommended.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
Just a small patch to allow certain weapons to load this new ammo.

Intended as a starting point for whoever wants to work with the framework. You can take this and expand it as you will.

The Skorpion vz.61 chambered in .32 ACP and vz. 64 in .380 ACP are added to the game. The vanilla Skorpion is properly designated as the later, experimental vz.68 chambered in 9x19.
These vz.61 and 64 versions are cheaper, weaker, only carried by the poorest of rookies, but they're offered dirty chap and new game and you can attach silencers from the get go without upgrades.
They will be affected by any remodel and reanimation you apply to the vanilla Skorpion.

MP-412 Rex will be able to load .380 ACP without further ado. Very simple config change, not ideal on execution, but works for now. Arti's Ballistics should alleviate any issues.

Integration into the vanilla corpse, reward, and stash systems.

Integration into Grok's Stash Overhaul and PDA Interactive.
