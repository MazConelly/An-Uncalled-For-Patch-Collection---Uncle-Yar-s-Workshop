Boomsticks and Sharpsticks [Mich]

-Compatibility:

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
I've seen plenty of people ask "BaS guns don't have any parts. Any mods for it?" But thing is, uh, BaS already assigns parts to its guns! But for whatever reason people end up not seeing them.

One possible situation could be overwriting. BaS has its own copy of the vanilla parts.ltx file with its guns added to it. In case some other mod overwrites it, this DLTX file should help ensure this doesn't happen.

Integration into the vanilla dynamic item spawn, reward, and stash systems.

Integration into Grok's Stash Overhaul.

-Patches:

Bigger Ammo Boxes (DLTX Minimod) + BaS.
Makes that mod cover the BaS ammo. File renamed to ensure being loaded last. Original mod not required.

Cheaper Ammo (DLTX Minimod) + BaS.
Makes that mod cover the BaS ammo. File renamed to ensure being loaded last. Original mod not required.
