-Module:
AR Pack Complete [Sibercat, TheMrDemonized, Lassie]

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
This is for the pack by Lassie, not the original by Sibercat or the DLTX rework by Demonized.

NOTE: To avoid issues with this Lite option, make sure to go into the original mod's meshes folder and disable the folders wpn_m4, wpn_m4a1. And inside the folder m16, disable all wpn_m16a4 files EXCEPT wpn_m16a4_hud_animation.omf and the wpn_m16a4_m203 files. Or don't install them.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
Fixed the scope_ui.xml files not having all the data needed that caused crashes if AR Pack loaded after BaS, added a couple fixed sounds Lassie had in the Anomaly Discord, the missing description for the Colt M16A1 Scope, and removed the DDM4 V7 from the new game loadouts for Mercenaries (seriously, a quick silenced assault rifle with 45 rounds mags and a Leupold scope? And then you give it to Nimble and master rank stalkers to act as if it were rare. C'ome oooooon).

The DDM4 can now attach and detach a silencer (instead of having a fixed one) and is now its own independent thing. This leaves the vanilla M16A2 back in its place, but this way the whole thing will be compatible with something like Billwa's M16A2 Replacer.

Gathered all icons into a single file. During the process, I trashed out out all the icons with a scope after pooping out another without handle or scope, and used that one for attachment overlays. These overlays won't be 100% on point, but when are they?

The Mags Redux files are also tweaked. Some data was redundant when it could just use the default one. Also given the DDM4v7 has a 45 round mag size, I made a new such extended mag item. You're welcome.

Integrated into vanilla actor effects.

Integrated into Arszi's Mutant Bleeding + Optimized Patch, Interactive PDA, Lootboxes, and Urban Tactics.

The Lite option includes everything mentioned, but adds only the new rifles (DDM4 V7, alt M4A1 RAS, M16A4 Long M203, M16A1) for further compatibility with whatever else you may choose to remodel/reanimate the vanilla AR rifles.
