-Module:
10mm Auto Ecosystem [MrB]

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
NOTE: You need the original mod for both Fixes and Lite options. You may disable the gamedata/configs and gamedata/textures/ui folders.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
Implemented the mercenary traders fixes that weren't included yet into the original mod, and fixed the MP510 Operative icon and reload sound issues.

Gathered all icons into one single file, and touched up the text a bit to reduce spacing. Consolidated trade files as well as possible.

And to reduce the use of resources, all weapons will use their unscoped world model for all scoped instances (except the upgraded versions).

Integrated into vanilla actor effects.

Integrated into Arszi's Mutant Bleeding + Optimized Patch, Interactive PDA, and Lootboxes.

The Lite option includes everything mentioned, but disables some of the new guns. This is meant for performance. I don't want to ruin the whole point of the "ecosystem", but this option will disable some of the guns with the worst optimizated models and redundant choices: the Banshee MkGs, Bren Ten SF, Glock 29, Kimber Eclipse and Jagare, and KRISS Gen1 (30 materials!?).
Some like the Kriss Gen2 and Gen 3, P220 (10mm), and USP 10 have a pass for now but could be taken down in the future.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Patches:
Armor Modkits addon. The original upgrade kits are removed to control item bloat, and universal use mod kits will be used for the upgrades.
Do not mix the Fixes and Lite options!
